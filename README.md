# FriendFinder
My version of the FriendFinder app.

## What Does My APP do?

* Created a match making web survey based on the Pokemon Elemental properties.

* First, the user is brought to the home page, where they are introduced what kind of survey it is. And there is a link button that takes them to the actual survey when clicked.

* Next, when the user clicks on the button that takes them to the survey questions, it asks them for their name and a link to a photo of them. When they fill in their information, the question are already listed below and they just have to choose, from the dropdown menu, what they feel like fits them the most, based on a scale from 1 to 5.

* When completed, the user then submit their answers to the website and processes their answers and gives them a match that closely is related to one of the preset element answers.
